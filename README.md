This is where you'll find all of the assets that make up [helm.sh](https://helm.sh/), the website for the [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) project. If you're looking to edit docs, report a website bug, or write a new blog post, you've come to the right place!


## Development

Helm.sh is a simple [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) static site. To run the website locally, you'll need to first install the dependencies:

```
yarn
```

You can then compile and run the site locally:

```
yarn start
```

## Deployment [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8ffabb30-f2f4-45cc-b0fa-1b4adda00b5e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/helm-merge/deploys)

Changes are automatically deployed to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/helm-merge/deploys) when merged to `main`. Build logs can be found [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/helm-merge/deploys).

## Contributing

Anyone can submit a PR to edit Helm.sh. We require commits be signed - please refer to the [contributing guide](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work).

Pull requests require [maintainer](https://github.com/helm/helm-www/blob/main/OWNERS) approval before merge.


### How to Edit The Helm Docs

Helm v4 documentation is located in this repo under `/docs/`. The sidebar for the Helm v4 docs is located at `sidebars.js`.

Helm v3 documentation is located under `versioned-docs/version-3`. The sidebar for the Helm v3 docs is located at `versioned-sidebars/sidebars-version-2.js`

For earlier versions, see the dev-v2 branch of the main Helm repo [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/tree/dev-v2/docs).


### Updating the Helm CLI Reference Docs

The documentation for the list of Helm CLI Commands are [exported](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/a6b2c9e2126753f6f94df231e89b2153c2862764/cmd/helm/root.go#L169) from the main helm project repo and rendered [here on the website](https://helm.sh/docs/helm) as a reference.

To update these docs, you'll need to:

1. Delete all plugins currently installed with `helm plugin uninstall`
2. Navigate to `content/en/docs/helm/`
3. Run `HOME='~' helm docs --type markdown --generate-headers` to generate the markdown docs files, replacing any prior markdown files.  **Note:** Make sure you run the version of helm you want to build the docs for (for example, by checking out the correct tag and building it)
4. Commit the changes and create a PR to update the website.


### How to Write a Blog Post

Blog posts are created via pull requests. The following steps are used to add them:

1) Add a new file to the `/blog/` directory whose name is the published date and the title. The files must be markdown formatted. See the existing titles for examples of the format
2) Add the header meta-data to the file using this format. 

```yaml
---
title: "Blog Title"
slug: "blog-slug"
# from /blog/authors.yml
authors: ["firstlast"]
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---
```
3) If this is the first blog post by this author, update `/blog/authors.yml` to add a new author record.
```yaml
# authors.yml
johndoe:
  name: John Doe
  image_url: https://github.com/johndoe.png
  page: true
  socials:
    github: johndoe
    linkedin: johndoe
    website: http://johndoe.com/
```
4) Add the content below the `---` as Markdown. The title does not need to be included in this section
5) Any images should be placed in the `/blog/images/` directory. Images should be losslessly compressed to reduce their size. Tools, such as [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/), can be used.
6) To summarize the content on the blog index page, insert a `<!--truncate-->` break in your markdown. This will truncate the content with a _Read More_ link.

Blog PRs require approval from the core Helm [maintainers](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/OWNERS) before merge.

### Versioning

The following files in this repo are used to control versioning:
* Versioned documentation is located in `versioned_docs`.
* The corresponding sidebar for each version is located in `versioned_sidebars`.
* Versioning behavior is managed in the `docusaurus.config.js` file:

    ```js
    export default {
      presets: [
        '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
        docs: {
        // lastVersion = the latest released version (either a specific version from /versioned_docs or 'current')
        // For any versions not listed as the latest, a banner is automatically displayed to warn users that they are viewing either old or pre-release docs  
          lastVersion: '3',
          versions: {
            // current = docs from the top-level /docs directory. These can be pre-release or the latest released version
            // label = the version label displayed in the navbar dropdown    
            current: { label: '4.0.0-alpha.1 ðŸš§' },
            // numbered versions correspond to directories in /versioned_docs 
            '3': { label: '3.19.0' },
            '2': { label: '2.17.0' },
          },
        },
      ],
    };
    ```
* The list of available versions is maintained in `versions.json`.

The table below explains the version labels and URL paths that map to versioned docs in this repo:

| Repo Path                               | Version                | URL Path           |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| `versioned_docs/version-2/filename.md`  | 2.17.0                 | /docs/2/filename   |
| `versioned_docs/version-3/filename.md`  | 3.19.0 (latest)        | /docs/filename     |
| `docs/filename.md`                      | 4.0.0-alpha.1 (current)| /docs/next/filename|

#### How to move pre-release docs to GA

Docusaurus has support for publishing _pre-release_ (alpha, beta) documentation. By default, pre-release documentation is published at helm.sh/docs/next and is served from the top-level `/docs` directory in this repo. Additionally, Docusaurus automatically applies a banner to all pre-release documentation to notify users that they are viewing unreleased docs.

When a pre-release version of Helm is promoted to GA, do the following to move pre-release docs from helm.sh/docs/next to helm.sh/docs:

1. Update `docusaurus.config.js` to set `lastVersion` to `'current'`. This publishes the content of the main `/docs` folder to helm.sh`/docs`.

    ```js
    // docusaurus.config.js
    lastVersion: 'current',
    ```

1. Update the navbar `label` for the `current` version. For example:

    ```js
    // docusaurus.config.js
    current: { label: '4.0.0' },
    ```

1. Start a local preview to test your changes. You should see that the "unreleased" banner is removed from the current version, and that the current version is now available at helm.sh/docs, rather than at helm.sh/docs/next.

#### How to cut a new pre-release version

Cutting a new version refers to copying the full `/docs` directory contents to a versioned folder in `versioned_docs`. You cut a version when you are ready to publish a new _major_ pre-release version of the docs. This is usually when a new alpha version of Helm is being developed and is ready to be documented.

**Note:** Cutting a new version is _not_ recommend until a pre-release version of Helm is being developed and is ready to be documented. Otherwise, the docs will need to be maintained in two places (both `/docs` and the latest `/versioned_docs` folder), creating extra work for maintainers to make sure they stay in-sync. Instead, see _How to move pre-release docs to GA_ below.

To cut a new version:

1. Run `npm run docusaurus docs:version version-<version>`, where `<version>` is an integer that corresponds to a major Helm version. For example, if you want to publish new pre-release docs for Helm v5, then you can run `npm run docusaurus docs:version version-4` to copy the v4 docs content to a new `version-4` folder.

     This command does the following:
     * Copies the full `docs/` folder contents into a new `versioned_docs/version-<version>/` folder.
     * Creates a versioned sidebars file in `versioned_sidebars/version-<version>-sidebars.json`.
     * Appends the new version number to `versions.json`.

1. Update the `docusaurus.config.js` file:

     1. Set `lastVersion` to to the latest GA version. This ensures that the docs at helm.sh/docs are served from the latest versioned_docs folders. And, the docs at helm.sh/docs/next are served from the main `/docs` folder.
     
         For example, if you just cut the Helm v4 docs to a `versioned_docs/version-4/` directory, and want to publish pre-release docs for version Helm v5.0.0-alpha.1, then set `lastVersion` to `'4'`.

     1. Update the navbar `label` for the `current` version. For example, to label the current (pre-release) version `5.0.0-alpha.1`, update the label as follows:

         ```js
         current: { label: '5.0.0-alpha.1 ðŸš§' },
         ```

1. Start a local preview to test your changes. You should see the new version in the dropdown, be able to access the pre-release docs at helm.sh/docs/next, and see an "unreleased" banner at the top of all the pre-released docs.             

For more information about cutting new docs versions, see [Versioning](https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning) in the Docusaurus documentation.
