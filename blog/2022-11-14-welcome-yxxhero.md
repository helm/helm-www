The Helm project is happy to welcome [yxxhero](https://github.com/yxxhero) as our newest maintainer for the helm-www repo! 
<!-- truncate --> yxxhero has been a long time contributor to the Helm project over the years. With a supermajority vote from the existing maintainers, yxxhero will be joining to help with Helm documentation. With their background, yxxhero will continue to help strengthen both our simplified and traditional Chinese docs.

Cheers to yxxhero!
