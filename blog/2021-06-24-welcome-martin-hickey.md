Meet Helm's newest org maintainer: [Martin Hickey](https://hickeyma.github.io/). Martin has been a longtime Helm project maintainer. He was instrumental in the development of Helm 3, and has been one of the most active maintainers on the project. He is also one of the creators of the [Helm 2-to-3 migration plugin](https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3).<!-- truncate -->

This week, the Helm maintainers voted to elect Martin onto the Helm Org Maintainers board. In this new role, Martin will help shape not just Helm, but the many projects that are hosted together with Helm. As a first order of business, Martin will be migrating the [Map KubeAPIs plugin](https://github.com/hickeyma/helm-mapkubeapis) to the Helm organization.

Congratulations to Martin!
