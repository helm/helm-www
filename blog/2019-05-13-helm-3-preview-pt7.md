This is the seventh and final part of our *Helm 3 Preview: Charting Our Future* blog series. Read our previous blog post on library charts [here](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-preview-pt6/).

Helm 3.0.0-alpha.1 is the foundation upon which we'll begin to build the next version of Helm. The features shared over the last few weeks were some of the big promises we made for Helm 3. Many of those features are still in their early stages and that is OK; the idea of an alpha release is to test out an idea, gather feedback from early adopters, and validate those assumptions.<!-- truncate -->

Once the alpha has been released, we can start accepting patches from the community for Helm 3. We should have a stable foundation on which to build and accept new features, and users should feel empowered to open tickets and contribute fixes.

In this blog series, I have tried to highlight some of the big improvements coming to Helm 3, but this list is by no means exhaustive. The full plan for Helm 3 includes features such as improved upgrade strategies, deeper integrations with OCI registries, and applying JSON schemas against chart values for validation purposes. We’re also taking a moment to clean up the codebase and updating parts that have languished over the last three years.

If you feel like a topic was missed, we'd love to hear your thoughts!

Feel free to join the discussion in [our Slack channels](https://kubernetes.slack.com):

 - `#helm-users` for questions and just to hang out with the community
 - `#helm-dev` for discussing PRs, code, and bugs

You can also join and hang out in our weekly Public Developer Calls on Thursdays at 09:30PDT. The meeting is focused on discussing what the core maintainers and the community are working on, as well as any discussion topics for the week. Anyone is welcome to join this call and participate. The link is in the `#helm-dev` Slack channel.

TTFN, ta ta for now!
