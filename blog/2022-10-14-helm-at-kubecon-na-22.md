Our maintainers will be hanging out at our Helm project booth the second half of each day. We'd love to learn from the community how Helm is being used, what pain points exists, and what users are looking for in the future. Help us help you by sharing your thoughts in our [Helm User Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeR9fSlWShh49_URhAEPA88JVjlPiz1441CA1B2ySJGZg1dzQ/viewform), even if you're unable to drop by the booth. 

Now for the fun part – the Helm booth will be giving away 3D Helm stickers, glow-in-the-dark Helm stickers, Helm bike bells, or limited edition Helm + Carhartt beanies to stay warm while in Detroit!

With that, we'll see the Helm community soon in-person!
