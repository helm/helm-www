Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish — so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.

The latest version of Helm is maintained by the [CNCF](https://cncf.io) - in collaboration with [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [Google](https://google.com), [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com) and the [Helm contributor community](https://github.com/helm/community).
