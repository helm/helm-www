Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. 

Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish — so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.

Helm is a graduated project in the [CNCF](https://cncf.io) and is maintained by the [Helm community](https://github.com/helm/community).

### Where to begin?

Helm is a big project with a lot of users and contributors. It can be a lot to take in!

We have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) if you want to help but don't know where to start.

### What do I do?

Before you contribute some code, please read our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). It goes over the processes around creating and reviewing pull requests.

Once you write some code, please [sign your commits](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-dco/index.html) to ensure Helm adheres to the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) agreement used by the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).
