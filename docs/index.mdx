Helm v4 represents a significant evolution from v3, introducing breaking changes, new architectural patterns, and enhanced functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility for charts.

For information about what's new and what to test, see [Helm 4 Overview](overview.md).

For complete technical details, see the [Full Changelog](changelog.md). The changelog will be updated with each new pre-release as we work toward the first Helm 4 Major release at KubeCon Atlanta this November!

For more information about the planned Helm 4 release phases, see [Path to Helm v4](https://helm.sh/blog/path-to-helm-v4/).
