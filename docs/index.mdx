Helm v4 represents a significant evolution from v3, introducing breaking changes, new architectural patterns, and enhanced functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility for charts.

See below for an [Overview](overview.md) of what's changed and what you can test.

There is also a full [Full Changelog](changelog.md), which will be updated with each new pre-release as we work toward the first Helm 4 Major release at KubeCon Atlanta this November!
