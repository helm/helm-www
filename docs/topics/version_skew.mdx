This document describes the maximum version skew supported between Helm 4 and
Kubernetes.

## Supported Versions

Helm versions are expressed as `x.y.z`, where `x` is the major version, `y` is
the minor version, and `z` is the patch version, following [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) terminology.

The Helm project maintains a release branch for the most recent minor release.
Applicable fixes, including security fixes, are cherry-picked into the release
branch, depending on severity and feasibility. More details can be found in
[Helm's release policy](/topics/release_policy.md).

## Supported Version Skew

When a new version of Helm is released, it is compiled against a particular
minor version of Kubernetes. For example, Helm v4.0.0 interacts with Kubernetes
using the Kubernetes 1.34.1 client, so it is compatible with Kubernetes 1.34.

As of Helm 4, Helm is assumed to be compatible with `n-3` versions of Kubernetes
it was compiled against.

For example, if you are using a version of Helm 4 that was compiled against the
Kubernetes v1.35 client APIs, then it should be safe to use with Kubernetes v1.35,
v1.34, v1.33, and v1.32.

It is not recommended to use Helm with a version of Kubernetes that is newer
than the version it was compiled against, as Helm does not make any forward
compatibility guarantees.

If you choose to use Helm with a version of Kubernetes that it does not support,
you are using it at your own risk.

Please refer to the table below to determine what version of Helm is compatible
with your cluster.

| Helm Version | Supported Kubernetes Versions |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 4.0.x        | 1.34.x - 1.31.x               |
