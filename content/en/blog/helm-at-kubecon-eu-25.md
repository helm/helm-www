## Helm Maintainer Track Talk: [Helm 4 You](https://sched.co/1td0b)

DATE: Thursday April 3

TIME: 16:45 - 17:15 BST

LOCATION: Level 3 | ICC Capital Suite 10-12

Join Helm maintainers [Matt Farina](https://bsky.app/profile/mattfarina.com) and [Andrew Block](https://bsky.app/profile/andyserver.com) as they provide an update on the next major version of Helm, the timelines, and the features being evaluated. They will also share how the community has been inspirational in helping make Helm 4 a reality. Since Helm continues to be a crucial component in the workflows of users and enterprises worldwide, a new version of Helm is only possible thanks to the continued collaboration from the Cloud Native community.

Full details on the talk can be found on the [session page](https://sched.co/1td0b).
