Ten years ago, in a hackathon shortly after the release of Kubernetes 1.1.0, Helm was born.

[The first commit](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic/commit/ecad6e2ef9523a0218864ec552bbfc724f0b9d3d) can be found on the helm-classic Git repository where the codebase for Helm v1 is located. This is the original Helm, before it merged with Deployment Manager and was folded into the Kubernetes project.<!--more-->

This commit was just the beginning. Helm would be shown off at the first KubeCon, just a few weeks later. From there Helm development would take off and a community of developers and charts would follow.

Happy 10th Birthday, Helm!
