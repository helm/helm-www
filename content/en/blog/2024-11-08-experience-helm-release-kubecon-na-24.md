Have you ever wondered what it takes to perform a software release of one of the most popular tools in the Kubernetes community? While you may envision a series of complex steps or maybe even some black magic (some of which may be true), the release process is much more organized and streamlined than you may have envisioned. However, until you see it for yourself firsthand, these types of questions will continue to go unfulfilled. Seeing it really is believing it!

Join maintainers and members of the Helm community at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America at the Demo Theater during the booth crawl on Wednesday November 13 at 7pm MST as we review the process involved to perform a release of the latest version of Helm so that it can be made available to the entire cloud native community. Along the way, you will learn about the associated activities, individuals, and processes involved with taking source code and transforming it into a consumable artifact for all across a myriad of supported runtimes and platforms.

Whether you are a Helm aficionado or just have an interest in release engineering, this is a session that you certainly want to circle on your agendas!

Not able to make it to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America? Donâ€™t fret! The session will be recorded and made available at a later date.

This release session is just one of several Helm related events taking place at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024. A full overview can be found [here](2024-10-07-kubecon-na-24).
