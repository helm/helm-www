This guide shows how to install the Helm CLI. Helm can be installed either from
source, or from pre-built binary releases.

### From the Binary Releases

Every [release](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) of Helm provides binary
releases for a variety of OSes. These binary versions can be manually downloaded
and installed.

1. Download your [desired version](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)
2. Unpack it (`tar -zxvf helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz`)
3. Find the `helm` binary in the unpacked directory, and move it to its desired
   destination (`mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm`)

From there, you should be able to run the client and [add the stable repo](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/#initialize-a-helm-chart-repository): `helm help`.

**Note:** Helm automated tests are performed for Linux AMD64 only during CircleCi
builds and releases. Testing of other OSes are the responsibility of the community
requesting Helm for the OS in question. 

### From Homebrew (macOS)

Members of the Kubernetes community have contributed a Helm formula build to
Homebrew. This formula is generally up to date.

```console
brew install helm
```

(Note: There is also a formula for emacs-helm, which is a different project.)

### From Chocolatey (Windows)

Members of the Kubernetes community have contributed a [Helm
package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/kubernetes-helm) build to
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). This package is generally up to date.

```console
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

## From Script

Helm now has an installer script that will automatically grab the latest version
of Helm and [install it
locally](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3).

You can fetch that script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so
that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```console
$ curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3
$ chmod 700 get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
```

Yes, you can `curl
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash` that if
you want to live on the edge.

### From Canary Builds

"Canary" builds are versions of the Helm software that are built from the latest
master branch. They are not official releases, and may not be stable. However,
they offer the opportunity to test the cutting edge features.

Canary Helm binaries are stored at [get.helm.sh](https://get.helm.sh). Here are
links to the common builds:

- [Linux AMD64](https://get.helm.sh/helm-canary-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [macOS AMD64](https://get.helm.sh/helm-canary-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Experimental Windows
  AMD64](https://get.helm.sh/helm-canary-windows-amd64.zip)

### From Source (Linux, macOS)

Building Helm from source is slightly more work, but is the best way to go if
you want to test the latest (pre-release) Helm version.

You must have a working Go environment with [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
installed.

```console
$ cd $GOPATH
$ mkdir -p src/helm.sh
$ cd src/helm.sh
$ git clone https://github.com/helm/helm.git
$ cd helm
$ make
```

If required, it will first install dependencies, rebuild the `vendor/` tree, and
validate configuration. It will then compile `helm` and place it in `bin/helm`.

## Conclusion

In most cases, installation is as simple as getting a pre-built `helm` binary.
This document covers additional cases for those who want to do more
sophisticated things with Helm.

Once you have the Helm Client successfully installed, you can move on to using
Helm to manage charts and [add the stable repo](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/#initialize-a-helm-chart-repository).
