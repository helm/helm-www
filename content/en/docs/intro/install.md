This guide shows how to install the Helm CLI. Helm can be installed either from source, or from pre-built binary releases.

### From the Binary Releases

Every [release](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) of Helm
provides binary releases for a variety of OSes. These binary versions
can be manually downloaded and installed.

1. Download your [desired version](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases)
2. Unpack it (`tar -zxvf helm-v2.0.0-linux-amd64.tgz`)
3. Find the `helm` binary in the unpacked directory, and move it to its
   desired destination (`mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm`)

From there, you should be able to run the client: `helm help`.

### From Homebrew (macOS)

Members of the Kubernetes community have contributed a Helm formula build to
Homebrew. This formula is generally up to date.

```console
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

(Note: There is also a formula for emacs-helm, which is a different
project.)

### From Chocolatey (Windows)

Members of the Kubernetes community have contributed a [Helm package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/kubernetes-helm) build to
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). This package is generally up to date.

```console
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

## From Script

Helm now has an installer script that will automatically grab the latest version
of Helm and [install it locally](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get).

You can fetch that script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so
that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```console
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh
$ chmod 700 get_helm.sh
$ ./get_helm.sh
```

Yes, you can `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get | bash` that if you want to live on the edge.

### From Canary Builds

"Canary" builds are versions of the Helm software that are built from
the latest master branch. They are not official releases, and may not be
stable. However, they offer the opportunity to test the cutting edge
features.

Canary Helm binaries are stored at [get.helm.sh](https://get.helm.sh).
Here are links to the common builds:

- [Linux AMD64](https://get.helm.sh/helm-canary-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
- [macOS AMD64](https://get.helm.sh/helm-canary-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
- [Experimental Windows AMD64](https://get.helm.sh/helm-canary-windows-amd64.zip)

### From Source (Linux, macOS)

Building Helm from source is slightly more work, but is the best way to
go if you want to test the latest (pre-release) Helm version.

You must have a working Go environment with
[dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) installed.

```console
$ cd $GOPATH
$ mkdir -p src/helm.sh
$ cd src/helm.sh
$ git clone https://github.com/helm/helm.git
$ cd helm
$ make
```

If required, it will first install dependencies, rebuild the
`vendor/` tree, and validate configuration. It will then compile `helm` and
place it in `bin/helm`.

## Conclusion

In most cases, installation is as simple as getting a pre-built `helm`
binary. This document covers additional cases for those who want to do
more sophisticated things with Helm.

Once you have the Helm Client successfully installed, you can
move on to using Helm to manage charts.
