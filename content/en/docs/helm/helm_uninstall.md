## helm uninstall

uninstall a release

### Synopsis


This command takes a release name and uninstalls the release.

It removes all of the resources associated with the last release of the chart
as well as the release history, freeing it up for future use.

Use the '--dry-run' flag to see which releases will be uninstalled without actually
uninstalling them.


```
helm uninstall RELEASE_NAME [...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --description string   add a custom description
      --dry-run              simulate a uninstall
  -h, --help                 help for uninstall
      --keep-history         remove all associated resources and mark the release as deleted, but retain the release history
      --no-hooks             prevent hooks from running during uninstallation
      --timeout duration     time to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks) (default 5m0s)
      --wait                 if set, will wait until all the resources are deleted before returning. It will wait for as long as --timeout
```
