## helm dependency

manage a chart's dependencies

### Synopsis


Manage the dependencies of a chart.

Helm charts store their dependencies in 'charts/'. For chart developers, it is
often easier to manage dependencies in 'Chart.yaml' which declares all
dependencies.

The dependency commands operate on that file, making it easy to synchronize
between the desired dependencies and the actual dependencies stored in the
'charts/' directory.

For example, this Chart.yaml declares two dependencies:

    # Chart.yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: nginx
      version: "1.2.3"
      repository: "https://example.com/charts"
    - name: memcached
      version: "3.2.1"
      repository: "@my-remote-repo"


The 'name' should be the name of a chart, where that name must match the name
in that chart's 'Chart.yaml' file.

The 'version' field should contain a semantic version or version range.

The 'repository' value may be a URL pointing to a Chart Repository. Helm
expects that by appending '/index.yaml' to the URL, it should be able to
retrieve the chart repository's index.

The 'repository' value can instead refer by name to a repo added by
'[helm repo add](helm_repo_add.md)'. Prefix the repo name with 'alias:' or
'@' in the 'repository' value.

Starting from 2.2.0, repository can be defined as the path to the directory of
the dependency charts stored locally. The path should start with a prefix of
"file://". For example,

    # Chart.yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: nginx
      version: "1.2.3"
      repository: "file://../dependency_chart/nginx"

Version matching is supported even if the Chart is local.
