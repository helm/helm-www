## helm version

print the client version information

### Synopsis


Show the version for Helm.

This will print a representation the version of Helm.
The output will look something like this:

version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.2.1", GitCommit:"fe51cd1e31e6a202cba7dead9552a6d418ded79a", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.13.10"}

- Version is the semantic version of the release.
- GitCommit is the SHA for the commit that this version was built from.
- GitTreeState is "clean" if there are no local code changes when this binary was
  built, and "dirty" if the binary was built from locally modified code.
- GoVersion is the version of Go that was used to compile Helm.

When using the --template flag the following properties are available to use in
the template:

- .Version contains the semantic version of Helm
- .GitCommit is the git commit
- .GitTreeState is the state of the git tree when Helm was built
- .GoVersion contains the version of Go that Helm was compiled with

For example, `--template '{{.Version}}'` outputs `v3.5.4`. See `version` [unit test](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/main/cmd/helm/version_test.go) for further examples.
