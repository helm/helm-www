# The Chart Best Practices Guide

This guide covers the Helm Team's considered best practices for creating charts.
It focuses on how charts should be structured.

We focus primarily on best practices for charts that may be publicly deployed.
We know that many charts are for internal-use only, and authors of such charts
may find that their internal interests override our suggestions here.
