Helm uses a packaging format called _charts_. A chart is a collection of files
that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. A single chart might be
used to deploy something simple, like a memcached pod, or something complex,
like a full web app stack with HTTP servers, databases, caches, and so on.

Charts are created as files laid out in a particular directory tree. They can be
packaged into versioned archives to be deployed.

If you want to download and look at the files for a published chart, without
installing it, you can do so with `helm pull chartrepo/chartname`.

This document explains the chart format, and provides basic guidance for
building charts with Helm.

## The Chart File Structure

A chart is organized as a collection of files inside of a directory. The
directory name is the name of the chart (without versioning information). Thus,
a chart describing WordPress would be stored in a `wordpress/` directory.

Inside of this directory, Helm will expect a structure that matches this:

```text
wordpress/
  Chart.yaml          # A YAML file containing information about the chart
  LICENSE             # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing the license for the chart
  README.md           # OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file
  values.yaml         # The default configuration values for this chart
  values.schema.json  # OPTIONAL: A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
  charts/             # A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends.
  crds/               # Custom Resource Definitions
  templates/          # A directory of templates that, when combined with values,
                      # will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files.
  templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file containing short usage notes
```

Helm reserves use of the `charts/`, `crds/`, and `templates/` directories, and
of the listed file names. Other files will be left as they are.

## The Chart.yaml File

The `Chart.yaml` file is required for a chart. It contains the following fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: The chart API version (required)
name: The name of the chart (required)
version: A SemVer 2 version (required)
kubeVersion: A SemVer range of compatible Kubernetes versions (optional)
description: A single-sentence description of this project (optional)
type: The type of the chart (optional)
keywords:
  - A list of keywords about this project (optional)
home: The URL of this projects home page (optional)
sources:
  - A list of URLs to source code for this project (optional)
dependencies: # A list of the chart requirements (optional)
  - name: The name of the chart (nginx)
    version: The version of the chart ("1.2.3")
    repository: The repository URL ("https://example.com/charts") or alias ("@repo-name")
    condition: (optional) A yaml path that resolves to a boolean, used for enabling/disabling charts (e.g. subchart1.enabled )
    tags: # (optional)
      - Tags can be used to group charts for enabling/disabling together
    enabled: (optional) Enabled bool determines if chart should be loaded
    import-values: # (optional)
      - ImportValues holds the mapping of source values to parent key to be imported. Each item can be a string or pair of child/parent sublist items.
    alias: (optional) Alias to be used for the chart. Useful when you have to add the same chart multiple times
maintainers: # (optional)
  - name: The maintainers name (required for each maintainer)
    email: The maintainers email (optional for each maintainer)
    url: A URL for the maintainer (optional for each maintainer)
icon: A URL to an SVG or PNG image to be used as an icon (optional).
appVersion: The version of the app that this contains (optional). This needn't be SemVer.
deprecated: Whether this chart is deprecated (optional, boolean)
annotations:
  example: A list of annotations keyed by name (optional).
```

Other fields will be silently ignored.

### Charts and Versioning

Every chart must have a version number. A version must follow the [SemVer
2](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standard. Unlike Helm Classic, Helm v2
and later uses version numbers as release markers. Packages in repositories are
identified by name plus version.

For example, an `nginx` chart whose version field is set to `version: 1.2.3`
will be named:

```text
nginx-1.2.3.tgz
```

More complex SemVer 2 names are also supported, such as `version:
1.2.3-alpha.1+ef365`. But non-SemVer names are explicitly disallowed by the
system.

**NOTE:** Whereas Helm Classic and Deployment Manager were both very GitHub
oriented when it came to charts, Helm v2 and later does not rely upon or require
GitHub or even Git. Consequently, it does not use Git SHAs for versioning at
all.

The `version` field inside of the `Chart.yaml` is used by many of the Helm
tools, including the CLI. When generating a package, the `helm package` command
will use the version that it finds in the `Chart.yaml` as a token in the package
name. The system assumes that the version number in the chart package name
matches the version number in the `Chart.yaml`. Failure to meet this assumption
will cause an error.

### The `apiVersion` Field

The `apiVersion` field should be `v2` for Helm charts that require at least Helm
3. Charts supporting previous Helm versions have an `apiVersion` set to `v1` and
are still installable by Helm 3.

Changes from `v1` to `v2`:

- A `dependencies` field defining chart dependencies, which were located in a
  separate `requirements.yaml` file for `v1` charts (see [Chart
  Dependencies](#chart-dependencies)).
- The `type` field, discriminating application and library charts (see [Chart
  Types](#chart-types)).

### The `appVersion` Field

Note that the `appVersion` field is not related to the `version` field. It is a
way of specifying the version of the application. For example, the `drupal`
chart may have an `appVersion: 8.2.1`, indicating that the version of Drupal
included in the chart (by default) is `8.2.1`. This field is informational, and
has no impact on chart version calculations.

### The `kubeVersion` Field

The optional `kubeVersion` field can define semver constraints on supported
Kubernetes versions. Helm will validate the version constraints when installing
the chart and fail if the cluster runs an unsupported Kubernetes version.

Version constraints may comprise space separated AND comparisons such as
```
>= 1.13.0 < 1.15.0
```
which themselves can be combined with the OR `||` operator like in the following
example
```
>= 1.13.0 < 1.14.0 || >= 1.14.1 < 1.15.0
```
In this example the version `1.14.0` is excluded, which can make sense if a bug
in certain versions is known to prevent the chart from running properly.

Apart from version constrains employing operators `=` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=` the
following shorthand notations are supported

 * hyphen ranges for closed intervals, where `1.1 - 2.3.4` is equivalent to `>=
   1.1 <= 2.3.4`.
 * wildcards `x`, `X` and `*`, where `1.2.x` is equivalent to `>= 1.2.0 <
   1.3.0`.
 * tilde ranges (patch version changes allowed), where `~1.2.3` is equivalent to
   `>= 1.2.3 < 1.3.0`.
 * caret ranges (minor version changes allowed), where `^1.2.3` is equivalent to
   `>= 1.2.3 < 2.0.0`.

For a detailed explanation of supported semver constraints see
[Masterminds/semver](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver).

### Deprecating Charts

When managing charts in a Chart Repository, it is sometimes necessary to
deprecate a chart. The optional `deprecated` field in `Chart.yaml` can be used
to mark a chart as deprecated. If the **latest** version of a chart in the
repository is marked as deprecated, then the chart as a whole is considered to
be deprecated. The chart name can be later reused by publishing a newer version
that is not marked as deprecated. The workflow for deprecating charts, as
followed by the [kubernetes/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) project is:

1. Update chart's `Chart.yaml` to mark the chart as deprecated, bumping the
   version
2. Release the new chart version in the Chart Repository
3. Remove the chart from the source repository (e.g. git)

### Chart Types

The `type` field defines the type of chart. There are two types: `application`
and `library`. Application is the default type and it is the standard chart
which can be operated on fully. The [library chart]({{< ref
"/docs/topics/library_charts.md" >}}) provides utilities or functions for the
chart builder. A library chart differs from an application chart because it is
not installable and usually doesn't contain any resource objects.

**Note:** An application chart can be used as a library chart. This is enabled
by setting the type to `library`. The chart will then be rendered as a library
chart where all utilities and functions can be leveraged. All resource objects
of the chart will not be rendered.

## Chart LICENSE, README and NOTES

Charts can also contain files that describe the installation, configuration,
usage and license of a chart.

A LICENSE is a plain text file containing the
[license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license) for the chart. The
chart can contain a license as it may have programming logic in the templates
and would therefore not be configuration only. There can also be separate
license(s) for the application installed by the chart, if required.

A README for a chart should be formatted in Markdown (README.md), and should
generally contain:

- A description of the application or service the chart provides
- Any prerequisites or requirements to run the chart
- Descriptions of options in `values.yaml` and default values
- Any other information that may be relevant to the installation or
  configuration of the chart

When hubs and other user interfaces display details about a chart that detail is
pulled from the content in the `README.md` file.

The chart can also contain a short plain text `templates/NOTES.txt` file that
will be printed out after installation, and when viewing the status of a
release. This file is evaluated as a [template](#templates-and-values), and can
be used to display usage notes, next steps, or any other information relevant to
a release of the chart. For example, instructions could be provided for
connecting to a database, or accessing a web UI. Since this file is printed to
STDOUT when running `helm install` or `helm status`, it is recommended to keep
the content brief and point to the README for greater detail.

## Chart Dependencies

In Helm, one chart may depend on any number of other charts. These dependencies
can be dynamically linked using the `dependencies` field in `Chart.yaml` or
brought in to the `charts/` directory and managed manually.

### Managing Dependencies with the `dependencies` field

The charts required by the current chart are defined as a list in the
`dependencies` field.

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: apache
    version: 1.2.3
    repository: https://example.com/charts
  - name: mysql
    version: 3.2.1
    repository: https://another.example.com/charts
```

- The `name` field is the name of the chart you want.
- The `version` field is the version of the chart you want.
- The `repository` field is the full URL to the chart repository. Note that you
  must also use `helm repo add` to add that repo locally.
- You might use the name of the repo instead of URL

```console
$ helm repo add fantastic-charts https://fantastic-charts.storage.googleapis.com
```

```yaml
dependencies:
  - name: awesomeness
    version: 1.0.0
    repository: "@fantastic-charts"
```

Once you have defined dependencies, you can run `helm dependency update` and it
will use your dependency file to download all the specified charts into your
`charts/` directory for you.

```console
$ helm dep up foochart
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "local" chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "example" chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "another" chart repository
Update Complete. Happy Helming!
Saving 2 charts
Downloading apache from repo https://example.com/charts
Downloading mysql from repo https://another.example.com/charts
```

When `helm dependency update` retrieves charts, it will store them as chart
archives in the `charts/` directory. So for the example above, one would expect
to see the following files in the charts directory:

```text
charts/
  apache-1.2.3.tgz
  mysql-3.2.1.tgz
```

#### Alias field in dependencies

In addition to the other fields above, each requirements entry may contain the
optional field `alias`.

Adding an alias for a dependency chart would put a chart in dependencies using
alias as name of new dependency.

One can use `alias` in cases where they need to access a chart with other
name(s).

```yaml
# parentchart/Chart.yaml

dependencies:
  - name: subchart
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
    alias: new-subchart-1
  - name: subchart
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
    alias: new-subchart-2
  - name: subchart
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
```

In the above example we will get 3 dependencies in all for `parentchart`:

```text
subchart
new-subchart-1
new-subchart-2
```

The manual way of achieving this is by copy/pasting the same chart in the
`charts/` directory multiple times with different names.

#### Tags and Condition fields in dependencies

In addition to the other fields above, each requirements entry may contain the
optional fields `tags` and `condition`.

All charts are loaded by default. If `tags` or `condition` fields are present,
they will be evaluated and used to control loading for the chart(s) they are
applied to.

Condition - The condition field holds one or more YAML paths (delimited by
commas). If this path exists in the top parent's values and resolves to a
boolean value, the chart will be enabled or disabled based on that boolean
value.  Only the first valid path found in the list is evaluated and if no paths
exist then the condition has no effect.

Tags - The tags field is a YAML list of labels to associate with this chart. In
the top parent's values, all charts with tags can be enabled or disabled by
specifying the tag and a boolean value.

```yaml
# parentchart/Chart.yaml

dependencies:
  - name: subchart1
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
    condition: subchart1.enabled, global.subchart1.enabled
    tags:
      - front-end
      - subchart1
  - name: subchart2
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
    condition: subchart2.enabled,global.subchart2.enabled
    tags:
      - back-end
      - subchart2
```

```yaml
# parentchart/values.yaml

subchart1:
  enabled: true
tags:
  front-end: false
  back-end: true
```

In the above example all charts with the tag `front-end` would be disabled but
since the `subchart1.enabled` path evaluates to 'true' in the parent's values,
the condition will override the `front-end` tag and `subchart1` will be enabled.

Since `subchart2` is tagged with `back-end` and that tag evaluates to `true`,
`subchart2` will be enabled. Also note that although `subchart2` has a condition
specified, there is no corresponding path and value in the parent's values so
that condition has no effect.

##### Using the CLI with Tags and Conditions

The `--set` parameter can be used as usual to alter tag and condition values.

```console
helm install --set tags.front-end=true --set subchart2.enabled=false
```

##### Tags and Condition Resolution

- **Conditions (when set in values) always override tags.** The first condition
  path that exists wins and subsequent ones for that chart are ignored.
- Tags are evaluated as 'if any of the chart's tags are true then enable the
  chart'.
- Tags and conditions values must be set in the top parent's values.
- The `tags:` key in values must be a top level key. Globals and nested `tags:`
  tables are not currently supported.

#### Importing Child Values via dependencies

In some cases it is desirable to allow a child chart's values to propagate to
the parent chart and be shared as common defaults. An additional benefit of
using the `exports` format is that it will enable future tooling to introspect
user-settable values.

The keys containing the values to be imported can be specified in the parent
chart's `dependencies` in the field `import-values` using a YAML list. Each item
in the list is a key which is imported from the child chart's `exports` field.

To import values not contained in the `exports` key, use the
[child-parent](#using-the-child-parent-format) format. Examples of both formats
are described below.

##### Using the exports format

If a child chart's `values.yaml` file contains an `exports` field at the root,
its contents may be imported directly into the parent's values by specifying the
keys to import as in the example below:

```yaml
# parent's Chart.yaml file

dependencies:
  - name: subchart
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
    import-values:
      - data
```

```yaml
# child's values.yaml file

exports:
  data:
    myint: 99
```

Since we are specifying the key `data` in our import list, Helm looks in the
`exports` field of the child chart for `data` key and imports its contents.

The final parent values would contain our exported field:

```yaml
# parent's values

myint: 99
```

Please note the parent key `data` is not contained in the parent's final values.
If you need to specify the parent key, use the 'child-parent' format.

##### Using the child-parent format

To access values that are not contained in the `exports` key of the child
chart's values, you will need to specify the source key of the values to be
imported (`child`) and the destination path in the parent chart's values
(`parent`).

The `import-values` in the example below instructs Helm to take any values found
at `child:` path and copy them to the parent's values at the path specified in
`parent:`

```yaml
# parent's Chart.yaml file

dependencies:
  - name: subchart1
    repository: http://localhost:10191
    version: 0.1.0
    ...
    import-values:
      - child: default.data
        parent: myimports
```

In the above example, values found at `default.data` in the subchart1's values
will be imported to the `myimports` key in the parent chart's values as detailed
below:

```yaml
# parent's values.yaml file

myimports:
  myint: 0
  mybool: false
  mystring: "helm rocks!"
```

```yaml
# subchart1's values.yaml file

default:
  data:
    myint: 999
    mybool: true
```

The parent chart's resulting values would be:

```yaml
# parent's final values

myimports:
  myint: 999
  mybool: true
  mystring: "helm rocks!"
```

The parent's final values now contains the `myint` and `mybool` fields imported
from subchart1.

### Managing Dependencies manually via the `charts/` directory

If more control over dependencies is desired, these dependencies can be
expressed explicitly by copying the dependency charts into the `charts/`
directory.

A dependency can be either a chart archive (`foo-1.2.3.tgz`) or an unpacked
chart directory. But its name cannot start with `_` or `.`. Such files are
ignored by the chart loader.

For example, if the WordPress chart depends on the Apache chart, the Apache
chart (of the correct version) is supplied in the WordPress chart's `charts/`
directory:

```yaml
wordpress:
  Chart.yaml
  # ...
  charts/
    apache/
      Chart.yaml
      # ...
    mysql/
      Chart.yaml
      # ...
```

The example above shows how the WordPress chart expresses its dependency on
Apache and MySQL by including those charts inside of its `charts/` directory.

**TIP:** _To drop a dependency into your `charts/` directory, use the `helm
pull` command_

### Operational aspects of using dependencies

The above sections explain how to specify chart dependencies, but how does this
affect chart installation using `helm install` and `helm upgrade`?

Suppose that a chart named "A" creates the following Kubernetes objects

- namespace "A-Namespace"
- statefulset "A-StatefulSet"
- service "A-Service"

Furthermore, A is dependent on chart B that creates objects

- namespace "B-Namespace"
- replicaset "B-ReplicaSet"
- service "B-Service"

After installation/upgrade of chart A a single Helm release is created/modified.
The release will create/update all of the above Kubernetes objects in the
following order:

- A-Namespace
- B-Namespace
- A-Service
- B-Service
- B-ReplicaSet
- A-StatefulSet

This is because when Helm installs/upgrades charts, the Kubernetes objects from
the charts and all its dependencies are

- aggregrated into a single set; then
- sorted by type followed by name; and then
- created/updated in that order.

Hence a single release is created with all the objects for the chart and its
dependencies.

The install order of Kubernetes types is given by the enumeration InstallOrder
in kind_sorter.go (see [the Helm source
file](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/484d43913f97292648c867b56768775a55e4bba6/pkg/releaseutil/kind_sorter.go)).

## Templates and Values

Helm Chart templates are written in the [Go template
language](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/), with the addition of 50 or so
add-on template functions [from the Sprig
library](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig) and a few other [specialized
functions]({{< ref "/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks.md" >}}).

All template files are stored in a chart's `templates/` folder. When Helm
renders the charts, it will pass every file in that directory through the
template engine.

Values for the templates are supplied two ways:

- Chart developers may supply a file called `values.yaml` inside of a chart.
  This file can contain default values.
- Chart users may supply a YAML file that contains values. This can be provided
  on the command line with `helm install`.

When a user supplies custom values, these values will override the values in the
chart's `values.yaml` file.

### Template Files

Template files follow the standard conventions for writing Go templates (see
[the text/template Go package
documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) for details). An example
template file might look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: deis-database
  namespace: deis
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: deis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: deis-database
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: deis-database
    spec:
      serviceAccount: deis-database
      containers:
        - name: deis-database
          image: {{ .Values.imageRegistry }}/postgres:{{ .Values.dockerTag }}
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.pullPolicy }}
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_STORAGE
              value: {{ default "minio" .Values.storage }}
```

The above example, based loosely on
[https://github.com/deis/charts](https://github.com/deis/charts), is a template
for a Kubernetes replication controller. It can use the following four template
values (usually defined in a `values.yaml` file):

- `imageRegistry`: The source registry for the Docker image.
- `dockerTag`: The tag for the docker image.
- `pullPolicy`: The Kubernetes pull policy.
- `storage`: The storage backend, whose default is set to `"minio"`

All of these values are defined by the template author. Helm does not require or
dictate parameters.

To see many working charts, check out the [Kubernetes Charts
project](https://github.com/helm/charts)

### Predefined Values

Values that are supplied via a `values.yaml` file (or via the `--set` flag) are
accessible from the `.Values` object in a template. But there are other
pre-defined pieces of data you can access in your templates.

The following values are pre-defined, are available to every template, and
cannot be overridden. As with all values, the names are _case sensitive_.

- `Release.Name`: The name of the release (not the chart)
- `Release.Namespace`: The namespace the chart was released to.
- `Release.Service`: The service that conducted the release.
- `Release.IsUpgrade`: This is set to true if the current operation is an
  upgrade or rollback.
- `Release.IsInstall`: This is set to true if the current operation is an
  install.
- `Chart`: The contents of the `Chart.yaml`. Thus, the chart version is
  obtainable as `Chart.Version` and the maintainers are in `Chart.Maintainers`.
- `Files`: A map-like object containing all non-special files in the chart. This
  will not give you access to templates, but will give you access to additional
  files that are present (unless they are excluded using `.helmignore`). Files
  can be accessed using `{{ index .Files "file.name" }}` or using the
  `{{.Files.Get name }}` function. You can also access the contents of the file
  as `[]byte` using `{{ .Files.GetBytes }}`
- `Capabilities`: A map-like object that contains information about the versions
  of Kubernetes (`{{ .Capabilities.KubeVersion }}` and the supported Kubernetes
  API versions (`{{ .Capabilities.APIVersions.Has "batch/v1" }}`)

**NOTE:** Any unknown `Chart.yaml` fields will be dropped. They will not be
accessible inside of the `Chart` object. Thus, `Chart.yaml` cannot be used to
pass arbitrarily structured data into the template. The values file can be used
for that, though.

### Values files

Considering the template in the previous section, a `values.yaml` file that
supplies the necessary values would look like this:

```yaml
imageRegistry: "quay.io/deis"
dockerTag: "latest"
pullPolicy: "Always"
storage: "s3"
```

A values file is formatted in YAML. A chart may include a default `values.yaml`
file. The Helm install command allows a user to override values by supplying
additional YAML values:

```console
$ helm install --values=myvals.yaml wordpress
```

When values are passed in this way, they will be merged into the default values
file. For example, consider a `myvals.yaml` file that looks like this:

```yaml
storage: "gcs"
```

When this is merged with the `values.yaml` in the chart, the resulting generated
content will be:

```yaml
imageRegistry: "quay.io/deis"
dockerTag: "latest"
pullPolicy: "Always"
storage: "gcs"
```

Note that only the last field was overridden.

**NOTE:** The default values file included inside of a chart _must_ be named
`values.yaml`. But files specified on the command line can be named anything.

**NOTE:** If the `--set` flag is used on `helm install` or `helm upgrade`, those
values are simply converted to YAML on the client side.

**NOTE:** If any required entries in the values file exist, they can be declared
as required in the chart template by using the ['required' function]({{< ref
"/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks.md" >}})

Any of these values are then accessible inside of templates using the `.Values`
object:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: deis-database
  namespace: deis
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: deis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: deis-database
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: deis-database
    spec:
      serviceAccount: deis-database
      containers:
        - name: deis-database
          image: {{ .Values.imageRegistry }}/postgres:{{ .Values.dockerTag }}
          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.pullPolicy }}
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          env:
            - name: DATABASE_STORAGE
              value: {{ default "minio" .Values.storage }}
```

### Scope, Dependencies, and Values

Values files can declare values for the top-level chart, as well as for any of
the charts that are included in that chart's `charts/` directory. Or, to phrase
it differently, a values file can supply values to the chart as well as to any
of its dependencies. For example, the demonstration WordPress chart above has
both `mysql` and `apache` as dependencies. The values file could supply values
to all of these components:

```yaml
title: "My WordPress Site" # Sent to the WordPress template

mysql:
  max_connections: 100 # Sent to MySQL
  password: "secret"

apache:
  port: 8080 # Passed to Apache
```

Charts at a higher level have access to all of the variables defined beneath. So
the WordPress chart can access the MySQL password as `.Values.mysql.password`.
But lower level charts cannot access things in parent charts, so MySQL will not
be able to access the `title` property. Nor, for that matter, can it access
`apache.port`.

Values are namespaced, but namespaces are pruned. So for the WordPress chart, it
can access the MySQL password field as `.Values.mysql.password`. But for the
MySQL chart, the scope of the values has been reduced and the namespace prefix
removed, so it will see the password field simply as `.Values.password`.

#### Global Values

As of 2.0.0-Alpha.2, Helm supports special "global" value. Consider this
modified version of the previous example:

```yaml
title: "My WordPress Site" # Sent to the WordPress template

global:
  app: MyWordPress

mysql:
  max_connections: 100 # Sent to MySQL
  password: "secret"

apache:
  port: 8080 # Passed to Apache
```

The above adds a `global` section with the value `app: MyWordPress`. This value
is available to _all_ charts as `.Values.global.app`.

For example, the `mysql` templates may access `app` as `{{
.Values.global.app}}`, and so can the `apache` chart. Effectively, the values
file above is regenerated like this:

```yaml
title: "My WordPress Site" # Sent to the WordPress template

global:
  app: MyWordPress

mysql:
  global:
    app: MyWordPress
  max_connections: 100 # Sent to MySQL
  password: "secret"

apache:
  global:
    app: MyWordPress
  port: 8080 # Passed to Apache
```

This provides a way of sharing one top-level variable with all subcharts, which
is useful for things like setting `metadata` properties like labels.

If a subchart declares a global variable, that global will be passed _downward_
(to the subchart's subcharts), but not _upward_ to the parent chart. There is no
way for a subchart to influence the values of the parent chart.

Also, global variables of parent charts take precedence over the global
variables from subcharts.

### Schema Files

Sometimes, a chart maintainer might want to define a structure on their values.
This can be done by defining a schema in the `values.schema.json` file. A schema
is represented as a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). It might look
something like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "properties": {
    "image": {
      "description": "Container Image",
      "properties": {
        "repo": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "tag": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "type": "object"
    },
    "name": {
      "description": "Service name",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "port": {
      "description": "Port",
      "minimum": 0,
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "protocol": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "protocol",
    "port"
  ],
  "title": "Values",
  "type": "object"
}
```

This schema will be applied to the values to validate it. Validation occurs when
any of the following commands are invoked:

- `helm install`
- `helm upgrade`
- `helm lint`
- `helm template`

An example of a `values.yaml` file that meets the requirements of this schema
might look something like this:

```yaml
name: frontend
protocol: https
port: 443
```

Note that the schema is applied to the final `.Values` object, and not just to
the `values.yaml` file. This means that the following `yaml` file is valid,
given that the chart is installed with the appropriate `--set` option shown
below.

```yaml
name: frontend
protocol: https
```

```console
helm install --set port=443
```

Furthermore, the final `.Values` object is checked against *all* subchart
schemas. This means that restrictions on a subchart can't be circumvented by a
parent chart. This also works backwards - if a subchart has a requirement that
is not met in the subchart's `values.yaml` file, the parent chart *must* satisfy
those restrictions in order to be valid.

## Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Kubernetes provides a mechanism for declaring new types of Kubernetes objects.
Using CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs), Kubernetes developers can declare custom
resource types.

In Helm 3, CRDs are treated as a special kind of object. They are installed
before the rest of the chart, and are subject to some limitations.

CRD YAML files should be placed in the `crds/` directory inside of a chart.
Multiple CRDs (separated by YAML start and end markers) may be placed in the
same file. Helm will attempt to load _all_ of the files in the CRD directory
into Kubernetes.

CRD files _cannot be templated_. They must be plain YAML documents.

When Helm installs a new chart, it will upload the CRDs, pause until the CRDs
are made available by the API server, and then start the template engine, render
the rest of the chart, and upload it to Kubernetes. Because of this ordering,
CRD information is available in the `.Capabilities` object in Helm templates,
and Helm templates may create new instances of objects that were declared in
CRDs.

For example, if your chart had a CRD for `CronTab` in the `crds/` directory, you
may create instances of the `CronTab` kind in the `templates/` directory:

```text
crontabs/
  Chart.yaml
  crds/
    crontab.yaml
  templates/
    mycrontab.yaml
```

The `crontab.yaml` file must contain the CRD with no template directives:

```yaml
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: crontabs.stable.example.com
spec:
  group: stable.example.com
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: crontabs
    singular: crontab
    kind: CronTab
```

Then the template `mycrontab.yaml` may create a new `CronTab` (using templates
as usual):

```yaml
apiVersion: stable.example.com
kind: CronTab
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.name }}
spec:
   # ...
```

Helm will make sure that the `CronTab` kind has been installed and is available
from the Kubernetes API server before it proceeds installing the things in
`templates/`.

### Limitations on CRDs

Unlike most objects in Kubernetes, CRDs are installed globally. For that reason,
Helm takes a very cautious approach in managing CRDs. CRDs are subject to the
following limitations:

- CRDs are never reinstalled. If Helm determines that the CRDs in the `crds/`
  directory are already present (regardless of version), Helm will not attempt
  to install or upgrade.
- CRDs are never installed on upgrade or rollback. Helm will only create CRDs on
  installation operations.
- CRDs are never deleted. Deleting a CRD automatically deletes all of the CRD's
  contents across all namespaces in the cluster. Consequently, Helm will not
  delete CRDs.

Operators who want to upgrade or delete CRDs are encouraged to do this manually
and with great care.

## Using Helm to Manage Charts

The `helm` tool has several commands for working with charts.

It can create a new chart for you:

```console
$ helm create mychart
Created mychart/
```

Once you have edited a chart, `helm` can package it into a chart archive for
you:

```console
$ helm package mychart
Archived mychart-0.1.-.tgz
```

You can also use `helm` to help you find issues with your chart's formatting or
information:

```console
$ helm lint mychart
No issues found
```

## Chart Repositories

A _chart repository_ is an HTTP server that houses one or more packaged charts.
While `helm` can be used to manage local chart directories, when it comes to
sharing charts, the preferred mechanism is a chart repository.

Any HTTP server that can serve YAML files and tar files and can answer GET
requests can be used as a repository server. The Helm team has tested some
servers, including Google Cloud Storage with website mode enabled, and S3 with
website mode enabled.

A repository is characterized primarily by the presence of a special file called
`index.yaml` that has a list of all of the packages supplied by the repository,
together with metadata that allows retrieving and verifying those packages.

On the client side, repositories are managed with the `helm repo` commands.
However, Helm does not provide tools for uploading charts to remote repository
servers. This is because doing so would add substantial requirements to an
implementing server, and thus raise the barrier for setting up a repository.

## Chart Starter Packs

The `helm create` command takes an optional `--starter` option that lets you
specify a "starter chart".

Starters are just regular charts, but are located in
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/helm/starters`. As a chart developer, you may author charts that
are specifically designed to be used as starters. Such charts should be designed
with the following considerations in mind:

- The `Chart.yaml` will be overwritten by the generator.
- Users will expect to modify such a chart's contents, so documentation should
  indicate how users can do so.
- All occurrences of `<CHARTNAME>` will be replaced with the specified chart
  name so that starter charts can be used as templates.

Currently the only way to add a chart to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/helm/starters` is to
manually copy it there. In your chart's documentation, you may want to explain
that process.
