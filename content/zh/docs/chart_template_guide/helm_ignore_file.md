The `.helmignore` file is used to specify files you don't want to include in
your helm chart.

If this file exists, the `helm package` command will ignore all the files that
match the pattern specified in the `.helmignore` file while packaging your
application.

This can help in avoiding unnecessary or sensitive files or directories from
being added in your helm chart.

The `.helmignore` file supports Unix shell glob matching, relative path
matching, and negation (prefixed with !). Only one pattern per line is
considered.

Here is an example `.helmignore` file:

```
# comment
.git
*/temp*
*/*/temp*
temp?
```
