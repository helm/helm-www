## helm init

This command does not exist in Helm 3, following the [removal of Tiller](https://helm.sh/docs/faq/#removal-of-tiller). You no longer need to install Tiller in your cluster in order to use Helm.

If you are using Helm 2, go to [v2.helm.sh](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-init) to view the [Helm Init documentation](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/helm/#helm-init).
